    "❓ **Question** ❓ Let's first load the data. You don't have to understand what is going on in the function, it does not matter here.\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **Warning** ⚠️ The `load_data` function has a `percentage_of_sentences` argument. Depending on your computer, there are chances that a too large number of sentences will make your compute slow down, or even freeze - your RAM can even overflow. For that reason, **you should start with 10% of the sentences** and see if your computer handles it. Otherwise, rerun with a lower number. \n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **DISCLAIMER** ⚠️ **No need to play _who has the biggest_ (RAM) !** The idea is to get to run your models quickly to prototype. Even in real life, it is recommended that you start with a subset of your data to loop and debug quickly. So increase the number only if you are into getting the best accuracy. "
